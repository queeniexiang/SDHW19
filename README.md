K #19: Onions, Bell Peppers, and Celery, Oh My!   .

Due R 2018-05-03, 8:00am, EST.


1. Pick a year from the available years of US Population data from the following site:

https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets#population

2. Copy the data into your JS code as a string and run JSON.parse on it. This is not an exercise in reading data from a file.

3. Use JavaScript's map, filter, and reduce functions to reveal information about the data.


Provide at least 3 different measures (eg, "...of central tendency"â€¦). Some suggestions:
* % gender of entire population
* median age
* number of minors
* Use an HTML page to display information (don't forget to provide an explanation).
